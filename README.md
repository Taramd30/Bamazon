# Bamazon

## Overview
In this activity, I've created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills I learned. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. It also calculates a check-out price depending on the price and quantity of items.

## Technologies Used
Node.js & MySQL

## How to run: Terminal commands
1. git clone git@github.com:Taramd30/bamazon.git
2. cd bamazon
3. npm install
4. node bamazonManager.js
